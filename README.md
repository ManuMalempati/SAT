This project is a simple traffic monitoring and vehicle detection system using computer vision techniques in Python. 
The system processes video footage to detect traffic signals and vehicles crossing a specific line on the road. 
Additionally, the system captures screenshots of vehicles that run red lights and exceed a certain speed limit ancd stores relevant information, such as the time, date, and location of the incident.

Instructions:
Please open the folder in a code editor and run Main_App.py, create account, login and upload any one of the test footage files: video1.mp4, yellow.mp4 or red.mp4 included within the folder.
To Test the licence detection, please run Licence.py and feel free to upload an image of choice by changing the filename within the code in the file.

The following Python libraries are required to run the project:
cv2 (OpenCV)
numpy
matplotlib
Pillow
tkinter

Note: While this project might not work for all inputs, it is a genuine demonstration of my independent coding skills and a vital stepping stone in my software engineering career. :)
